            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h4>Education</h4>
            <p>I started my education journey way back in two thounsand and one.
               I joined class one in two thousand and two and finish class eight in two thousand and ten.
               I then join the o level in two thousand and eleven and finished it in two thousand and forteen.
               I then join the Moringa school in 2020 and still going on with my studies there.
               In two thousand and sixteen I volunteered to teach Rotik High school for two years. 
            </p>
            <h4>Job Experience</h4>
            <p>So far I can say I haven't been employed in any company in kenya but hopefully 
               after I finish my studies on Moringa School i will get employed.
               But in 2016 I volunteered to teach Mathematics a certain school.
               In 2018 I learnt about freelancing. Specifically the academic and transcription writing.
               I was hired by a certain company for transcription and worked there for a year or so.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Why I decided to take programming</h4>
                <p>Basically ,I love coding.I was motivated more to programming when I created interest on 
                   <span>software development</span> and especially when I came across alot of programming questions 
                   during my transcription job.</p>
